# **Characteristics of the Poincaré Plot Geometry**:
- **SD1**: SD1 is a measure of the spread of RR intervals on the Poincaré plot perpendicular to the line of identity.
It is an index of short-term RR interval fluctuations, i.e., beat-to-beat variability.
It is equivalent (although on another scale) to RMSSD, and therefore it is redundant to report correlations with both (Ciccone, 2017).
- **SD2**: SD2 is a measure of the spread of RR intervals on the Poincaré plot along the line of identity.
It is an index of long-term RR interval fluctuations.
- **SD1SD2**: the ratio between short and long term fluctuations of the RR intervals (SD1 divided by SD2).
- **S**: Area of ellipse described by SD1 and SD2 (``pi * SD1 * SD2``). It is proportional to *SD1SD2*.
- **CSI**: The Cardiac Sympathetic Index (Toichi, 1997), calculated by dividing the longitudinal variability of the Poincaré plot (``4*SD2``) by its transverse variability (``4*SD1``).
- **CVI**: The Cardiac Vagal Index (Toichi, 1997), equal to the logarithm of the product of longitudinal (``4*SD2``) and transverse variability (``4*SD1``).
- **CSI_Modified**: The modified CSI (Jeppesen, 2014) obtained by dividing the square of the longitudinal variability by its transverse variability.
- **Indices of Heart Rate Asymmetry (HRA), i.e., asymmetry of the Poincaré plot** (Yan, 2017)
- **GI**: Guzik's Index, defined as the distance of points above line of identity (LI) to LI divided by the distance of
all points in Poincaré plot to LI except those that are located on LI.
- **SI**: Slope Index, defined as the phase angle of points above LI divided by the phase angle of all points in Poincaré plot except
those that are located on LI.
- **AI**: Area Index, defined as the cumulative area of the sectors corresponding to the points that are located above LI divided by the
cumulative area of sectors corresponding to all points in the Poincaré plot except those that are located on LI.
- **PI**: Porta's Index, defined as the number of points below LI divided by the total number of points in Poincaré plot except those that are located on LI.
- **SD1d** and **SD1a**: short-term variance of contributions of decelerations (prolongations of RR intervals) and
accelerations (shortenings of RR intervals), respectively (Piskorski,  2011).
