# HRV analysis
- Data was acquired using brain products actiChanp plus
- EEG electrodes (11 and 22) were used for ECG data collection in lead I config
- ECG1 going to 11 (left) and ECG2 to 22 (right) (Cross check once)
- Did ECG2-ECG1
- mne-python has good amount of features in in-built visualisation
